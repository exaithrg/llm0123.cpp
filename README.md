# llm0123.cpp
Pure C++ implementation of various LLMs with support for multiple precisions.

**Working in progress...**

**FORKED.** A primary implementation to learn how transformers works, including training and inference. A minimal PyTorch re-implementation of the OpenAI GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) training

**FORKED.** The update of minGPT. The simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTs.

**FORKED.** LLM training in simple, raw C/CUDA, I don't care about LLM Training, so this repo isn't very useful.

**FORKED.** Inference Llama 2 in one file of pure C, seems have KV Caches implementations, very important.

Seems a little complex, I think its based on llama.cpp as it uses .gguf files

A faithful clone of Karpathy's llama2.c but fully functional with LLaMA 3 8B base and instruct models. Will it support LLAMA3.2-1B modelï¼Ÿ

**FORKED.** Llama3 inference in C++. **NO KV Caches**
